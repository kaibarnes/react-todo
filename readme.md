# Todo List

This is a todo list I made to practice using Redux with React.

It stores todos in local storage so they can be accessed and added to at any time, even when offline.
I also added a full set of tests using the Expect package.

The front end was built with React, and I used Foundation to quickly provide some basic styling.
